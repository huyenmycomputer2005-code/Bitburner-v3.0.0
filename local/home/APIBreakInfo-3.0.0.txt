API BREAK INFO FOR 3.0.0

You cannot use the deprecated VSCode extension to connect to the Steam app via API server now. You have to use Remote API to connect your external editors to Bitburner.
For more information, please check the Remote API page in the Documentation tab. If you have a question, please ask us on #external-editors on Discord (https://discord.gg/TFc3hKD).



The formatting functions have been moved to their own interface, ns.format.
Each function has been replaced with their corresponding interface variant.
Additionally, the naming of ns.tFormat has been changed to ns.format.time.

Usage of the following functions may have been affected:
ns.formatNumber
ns.formatRam
ns.formatPercent
ns.tFormat

Potentially affected files on server home (with line numbers):
hackScript.ts: (Line numbers: 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 31, 36, 40, 44)

Potentially affected files on server n00dles (with line numbers):

With some APIs, when you passed values to their params, you could pass a value that was not an exact match. For example, with ns.singularity.commitCrime, you could pass "Rob Store", "rob store", "RobStore", "robstore", "robStore", etc. This is called "fuzzy matching". Now, you must pass an exact value (i.e., Rob Store). This change affects:
- Bladeburner action and type: BladeburnerActionType, BladeburnerGeneralActionName, BladeburnerContractName, BladeburnerOperationName, BladeburnerBlackOpName, SpecialBladeburnerActionTypeForSleeve, BladeburnerActionTypeForSleeve.
- Crime: CrimeType
- Faction work: FactionWorkType
- University class: UniversityClassType
- Gym stat: GymType
- Job field: JobField
- Stock position: PositionType
- Stock order: OrderType
You can access these values via ns.enums and Bladeburner APIs.



Some APIs returned a default value when you passed the hostname of a non-hackable server (e.g., hacknet server) to them.
These APIs now throw an error. The affected APIs are:
